Today, "science" usually refers to a way of pursuing knowledge, not just the knowledge itself. It is mainly about the phenomena of the material world.[5] In the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature such as Newton's laws of motion. And over the course of the 19th century, the word "science" became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself, as a way to study the natural world, including physics, chemistry, geology and biology.
It was in the 19th century also that the term scientist was created by William Whewell. He meant it to distinguish those who sought knowledge on nature from those who sought other types of knowledge.[6]
The scientific method is the name given to the methods used by scientists to find knowledge. The main features of the scientific method are:
Scientists identify a question or a problem about nature. Some problems are simple, such as "how many legs do flies have?" and some are very deep, such as "why do objects fall to the ground?"
Next, scientists investigate the problem. They work at it, collecting facts. Sometimes all it takes is to look carefully.
Some questions cannot be answered directly. Then scientists suggest ideas, and test them out. They do experiments and collect data.
Eventually, they figure out what they think is a good answer to the problem. Then they tell people about it.
Later, other scientists may agree or not agree. They may suggest another answer. They may do more experiments. Anything in science might be revised if we find out the previous solution was not good enough.
